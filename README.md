# compound-telegram-bot-demo

## Overview
This is a **mini Telegram bot demo** designed to show basic interaction with the Compound protocol on Ethereum testnet.  
It serves as a **proof-of-skill** project for multi-chain DeFi development, Telegram automation, and EVM integration — directly aligned with advanced Compound automation tools and SDK development.

This repository is a **read-only demo**, intended to demonstrate understanding of:
- Ethereum / EVM interaction with `ethers.js`
- Compound testnet market data (USDC supply APY)
- Telegram bot integration using `node-telegram-bot-api`
- Basic automation logic (logging commands, responding to users)

---

## Features
- Connects to Ethereum testnet via `ethers.js`
- Fetches USDC supply APY from Compound
- Responds to `/apy` command in Telegram
- Logs user commands for demonstration purposes
- Lightweight, safe, and fully compatible with testnet
